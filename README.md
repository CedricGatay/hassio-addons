## Hue MQTT Bridge

Used to get values from dimmer switches easily.

Base addon forked from https://github.com/lazytesting/hassio-addons/tree/master/hue_mqtt_bridge with fixes to make it build properly with recent (0.99.x) versions of HA.

## iSystem to MQTT

Used to get heater settings from modbus bridge.

Using a forked version to handle `diematic3` boiler with `modulens` ones.
